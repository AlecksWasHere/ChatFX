# ChatFX

ChatFX is a plugin for Pocketmine-MP to let players who are given the permission change their chat colors.


## Usage

- Main command is /cfx OR /chatfx
- Permission for the UI - (required) in order to be able to pick anything: chatfx.cfx
- All colors permission: chatfx.cfx.*
- One word colors permissions: chatfx.cfx.red - chatfx.cfx.white - chatfx.cfx.blue.....
- Two word colors permissions: chatfx.cfx.darkgreen - chatfx.cfx.darkred - chatfx.cfx.lightpurple.....
- It also stores the color you pick until the server either restarts or you set it back to white!
